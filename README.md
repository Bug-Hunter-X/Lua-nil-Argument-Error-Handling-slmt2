# Lua nil Argument Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Lua programming: not handling nil arguments correctly.  The `bug.lua` file contains a function that doesn't properly check for a nil argument, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  `bugSolution.lua` presents a corrected version.

This is a simple but important example highlighting the need for robust error handling in Lua, especially when dealing with external data sources or user input, where nil values are entirely possible.
